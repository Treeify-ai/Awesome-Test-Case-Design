# Treeify Partnership Program — Co‑build & Co‑market

> A lightweight program for **KOLs/creators**, **product teams/companies**, and **tool partners** who want to **co‑build** high‑value testing content and **co‑market** with Treeify—without hype, with real outcomes.

---

## Who this is for
- **KOLs / Educators** who teach testing, QA, DevX, product quality.
- **Companies / Product teams** shipping features that benefit from better coverage and evidence.
- **Tool vendors / Integrations** that touch testing, CI, observability, API, or QA platforms.

---

## What you get (benefits)
- **Co‑building**
  - Co‑author guides, **domain playbooks**, and **mini‑projects** (brief → scenarios → cases → evidence).
  - Design reviews and editorial support to meet this repo’s **evidence‑driven** bar.
  - Early looks at upcoming Treeify workflows to align examples with reality.
- **Co‑marketing**
  - Joint posts (blog/newsletter), **case studies**, and **webinars/workshops**.
  - **Attribution** in repo pages + your logo in the Partners section.
  - Feature in release notes and social call‑outs (measured, not spammy).
- **Discovery & traffic**
  - Links from **README** and relevant pages; optional **UTM** tracking.
  - Inclusion in “featured scenarios” and “teaching kits” where relevant.
- **Support**
  - Office hours for review/feedback. Templates for checklists, CSVs, and evidence bundles.

> Promise: no over‑promotion. We keep tone **useful > salesy**, with measurable value.

---

## What we ask (lightweight)
- **Deliverables** per quarter (choose 1+):
  - 1 **mini‑project** or 2 **field notes** with real evidence,
  - or 1 **teaching kit** (workshop) used in the community,
  - or an **integration/export template** other teams can reuse.
- **Quality bar**: scenarios have clear **oracles**, cases attach **evidence** (logs/metrics/traces).
- **Neutrality**: solutions focus on **principles**; Treeify is shown as one **practical path**.
- **Cross‑links**: post on your channel; we reciprocate. Disclose partnership when relevant.

## Tracks
- **Creator / KOL**
  - Focus: education, explainers, workshops.
  - Output: tutorials, videos, mind‑maps, teaching kits.
- **Company / Product team**
  - Focus: repeatable patterns and **before/after** coverage wins.
  - Output: domain playbooks, mini‑projects, checklists, evidence bundles.
- **Tool / Integration partner**
  - Focus: export/import templates, CI sync, observability hooks.
  - Output: `/80-tools-and-integrations/*` contributions and sample repos.

## How it works
1. **Apply** (2 min): share area of interest, example links, preferred track.  
2. **Scope** (1 hr): pick topic + acceptance + evidence plan.  
3. **Co‑build** (2–4 wks): drafts → reviews → final PR.  
4. **Launch** (1 wk): joint post(s) + README link + social call‑outs.  
5. **Measure & iterate**: traffic, stars, sign‑ups, PRs inspired.

**Success signals**
- Repo: stars, visitors, PRs referencing your work.
- Partners: qualified leads, workshop attendance, sign‑ups.
- Quality: fewer regressions, better p95/p99, clearer observability.
